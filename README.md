Compucolor II computer emulator

This ia javascript-based emulator which runs in any modern browser, i.e., one which supports the Canvas element.

The Compucolor II was a 1977-era 8080-based microcomputer built into the housing of a 13" color TV.  It was one of the first home computers to support color graphics, and like many microcomputers of it's day, it booted into a BASIC interpreter.
